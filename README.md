# THE-Search-Engine
A Java search engine where you can either search for websites or create your own that end up being saved in a file to access every time

Goals: to have a search engine where you can search something and the results will be on the top if they are the most similar to the search and most viewed and if can also be advertised using currency (might not happen)

- we need to be able to create websites if we choose so
- need to have a check system to not allow websites that will return an error
- need to create a point system on similarity, amount viewed, and maybe ratings

all the work for now (:
